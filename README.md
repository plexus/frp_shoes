FRP Shoes
=========

Functional reactive programming with Shoooooooes.


Reference Implementation
------------------------

`reference.rb` contains a simple Shoes app, written in the usual Shoes style.
Basically, there are two buttons, +1 and -1, and a `para` with a count. It
starts at zero, and the buttons increment and decrement the count.
